## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  E.g. The parameter `INDEX` in the command `delete INDEX`.

* Parameters with `...` after them can be included multiple times<br>
  E.g. The parameter `KEYWORD` in the command `find TYPE KEYWORD...`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  E.g. The command `add` requires a few parameters such as `n/NAME`, `e/EMAIL` and `r/ROLE`. Placing these parameters in any order is acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but is specified multiple times, only the last occurrence of this parameter will be taken.<br>
  E.g. If `n/John Lam n/John Lee` is specified in the `add` command, only `n/John Lee` will be taken.

* Unneeded parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  E.g. The command `help 123` will be interpreted as `help`.
